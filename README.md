#Abstract
There is a lack of understanding of how higher education has been impacted by the Corona virus global pandemic. This study aims to explore grade outcomes for students at a level one research institution before, during, and after this public health emergency. An exploratory data analysis will examine and compare grade values outcomes by college, department, and division level. Anomaly detection indicated that the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences observed the greatest number of high DEW percentage courses. A time series analysis indicated that the lowest DEW percentages were observed during the first semester of the pandemic followed by the highest levels of DEW percentage courses in the next semester. A decision tree analysis found that fully online courses are a key factor in determining whether a course will be above average for the DEW percent. A regression analysis found a correlation between the DEW percent and fully online classes as well as classes offered in the second half session of a semester. An accurate predictive model was unable to be constructed during the course of this study. However, future research that extends the time frame of the data and includes more fine-grained data could yield further insights regarding relationships between grade value outcomes and course attributes.
