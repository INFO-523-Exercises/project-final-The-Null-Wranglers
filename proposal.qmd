## Introduction

Low student success rates have a profound impact on an educational institution's academic offerings, their ability to provide financial support and scholarships, as well as their overall professional reputation. Much is unknown about how the corona-virus pandemic has impacted student success in higher education. Thus, in order to better understand this impact, this study seeks to conduct a detailed examination of the grade value outcomes during this time. By examining the grade value outcomes for the years before, during and after the pandemic, patterns and trends may be discovered that might help guide student support services in the future. The analysis will breakdown the grade values outcomes by college, department, division level and course level using clustering and classification techniques. Anomalies will be isolated for a more fine grained inspection that includes course attributes. These course attributes will be used in an effort to create a model for predictive grade value outcomes.

## Goals

The high-level goal of this study is to analyze and understand the grade outcomes at the University of Arizona (UofA) pre-, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. This investigation revolves around two primary questions:

1.  Pattern Analysis -- What if any patterns or relationships exist between colleges, departments, or course level and grade outcomes for enrolled students?

2.  Predictive Modeling -- Can a predictive model be developed that accurately forecasts grade outcomes based on course attributes?

## Dataset

The first data set used for this analysis, is known as the DEW Rates, contains information about the breakdown of grade value outcomes during the academic years of 2018-19, 2019-20, and 2020-21 at the University of Arizona. The consists of 35697 observations of courses with 23 variables related to enrollment and grade values. Below is a description of the data:

## Exploratory Question

What patterns and variations exist in grade value outcomes across colleges, departments, and course levels during and after the COVID-19 pandemic?

## Predictive Question

How can course attributes associated with poor grade outcomes during this time pandemic predict future grade values for similar courses?

## Analysis plan

***Data Collection***

-   Historical Grade Data: Collect historical grade data from the University of Arizona for the years before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. This data should include information on grade value outcomes for courses by semester.

-   Course Attributes Data: Gather data on course attributes such as class size, instructional format (online, hybrid, in-person), faculty information, time and day of the class offering, and any other relevant features that might influence grade outcomes.

***Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)***

-   Descriptive Statistics: Calculate summary statistics for overall grade distributions, college-wise, department-wise, and course-level. Examine mean, median,sums, and any potential outliers.

***Pattern Analysis***

-   Clustering: Utilize clustering techniques to group colleges, departments, and courses based on similar grade outcomes. Evaluate if specific clusters show distinct patterns during the pandemic.

-   Classification: Apply classification algorithms to identify factors influencing grade outcomes. Investigate if colleges, departments, or specific course attributes significantly contribute to predicting grade results.

-   Anomaly Detection: Identify anomalies in grade distributions, focusing on courses or departments that experienced unexpected changes during the pandemic. Conduct a fine-grained inspection of these anomalies.

-   Time Series Decomposition: Decompose the time series data to identify trends, seasonality, and residual components. Analyze if any irregularities in the residual component coincide with the pandemic period.

***Predictive Modeling***

-   Feature Selection: Select relevant course attributes for predictive modeling. Use domain knowledge and statistical methods to choose features that significantly impact grade outcomes.

-   Model Development: Build predictive models using machine learning algorithms such as regression or classification. Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

    -   Decision Tree Analysis: Employ decision tree analysis to understand the hierarchy of factors influencing grade outcomes.

    -   Regression: Utilize regression for predictive model

-   Model Evaluation: Assess the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of the developed models. Compare models' performance across different colleges, departments, and course levels.

-   Interpretation: Interpret the results of the predictive models to understand the key factors influencing grade outcomes. Provide insights into how colleges, departments, and course attributes contribute to student success.

***Reporting***

-   Prepare a comprehensive report summarizing the methodology, findings, recommendations and potential future research. This report will include visualizations such as charts and graphs to enhance the presentation of results. Clearly communicate the findings of the study in an effort to student support services and academic planning at the University of Arizona.
