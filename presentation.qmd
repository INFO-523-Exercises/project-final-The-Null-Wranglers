You can use plain text - one plot about why we narrow down the data. Why just top 5 colleges, any one mean enrollment table.

## Plots

```{r}
penguins |>
  mutate(species = ifelse(species == "Adelie", "Adelie", "Other")) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Plot and text - Time Series Analysis


Time series analysis is a statistical method used to analyze and interpret sequential data points collected and ordered over time. It involves examining patterns, trends, and behaviors within the dataset to understand how the data evolves and changes across different time intervals. (add any image in the background)

```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.width=5.5}

               outlier.size = 2.5) +

## Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r}
penguins |> 
  head() |>
  kableExtra::kable() |>
  kableExtra::kable_styling()
```

## Images

## Math Expressions {.smaller}

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g.Â \$\\alpha+\\beta\$ renders $\alpha + \beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```         
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$
\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i
$$

Limitations:

1.  The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

2.  There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

# Wrap up

## Feeling adventurous?

-   You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

-   But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. Some solutions for this can be found at https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs.
