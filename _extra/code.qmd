Data Cleaning

Should we remove some of these columns? 

## Plots
```{r}
# total number of courses per semester?
dew_data %>% 
  group_by(TERM_LD) %>% 
  ggplot(aes( x = TERM_LD,
              fill = TERM_LD))+
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")
```

```{r}
# courses by level
dew_data %>% 
  group_by(TERM_LD, Course.Level) %>% 
  ggplot(aes( x = TERM_LD,
              fill = Course.Level))+
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")
```
We need to explain why there is so many more upper division courses

```{r}
#1 plot of enrollment grouped by division for each semester - Rohit
```


```{r}
#2 mean and median of each semester - Rohit

```


```{r}
#3 mean enrollment for course level by semester - Anjani

```

```{r fig.height=16, fig.width=12}
#4 facet wrap of colleges of upper and lower per semester by enrollment - Kristi
# courses by sections - some classes are offered more than once per semester could help explain the above results in course level
dew_data %>% 
  group_by(TERM_LD, Course.Level, College) %>% 
  summarise(total_enrolled = sum(Total.Student.Count)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes( x = TERM_LD,
              y = total_enrolled,
