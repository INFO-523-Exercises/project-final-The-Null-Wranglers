DEW Counts Data Set

The DEW counts data set contains information about the breakdown of grade value outcomes during the academic years of 18-19, 19-20, and 20-21. The consists of 35697 observations with 23 variables per observation. Below is a description of the data:

## Questions

1.  What if any patterns or relationships exist between colleges, departments, or course level and grade outcomes for enrolled students?

2.  Can a predictive model be developed that accurately forecasts grade outcomes based on course attributes?

#### **Why these questions?**

Low student success rates have a profound impact on an educational institution's academic offerings, their ability to provide financial support and scholarships, as well as their overall professional reputation. The impacts of covid-19 on student success is a concern in higher education. Thus, it is important that this vital issue be addressed with unique strategies and innovative plans that are based on research that is data driven.

## Analysis plan

-   A plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged in (if any).

**Week 1 Nov 1st - Nov 7th**

-   Finalize proposal - group

-   Clean and explore data - group

-   Assign roles and responsibilities

**Week 2 Nov 8th - Nov 14th**

-   Exploratory data analysis

-   Continue data preprocessing.

-   Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify initial trends and patterns.

**Week 3 Nov 15th - Nov 21st**

-   Anomaly and time series analysisÂ 

**Week 4 Nov 22nd - Nov 28th**

-   Decision Tree Analysis

**Week 5 Nov 29th - Dec 5th**

-   (Ambitious goal :))Predictive modeling if time permits

**Week 6 Dec 6th - 12th**
